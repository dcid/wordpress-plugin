The Sucuri WordPress Security plugin is a security toolset for security integrity monitoring, malware detection and security hardening.


== Description ==


Sucuri Inc is a globally recognized authority in all matters related to
website security, with specialization in WordPress Security.

The Sucuri Security WordPress Security plugin is free to all WordPress users.
It is a security suite meant to complement your existing security posture. It
offers it’s users four key security features for their website, each designed
to have a positive affect on their security posture:

<ol>
<li>Security Activity Auditing</li>
<li>File Integrity Monitoring</li>
<li>Remote Malware Scanning</li>
<li>Blacklist Monitoring</li>
<li>Effective Security Hardening</li>
<li>Post-Hack Security Actions</li>
<li>Security Notifications</li>
<li>Website Firewall (add on)</li>
</ol>


= Security Activity Monitoring =

This is perhaps the most underutilized security function. It’s the act of
monitoring all security related events within your WordPress install. The
challenge is, what makes up a security event. In the eyes of Sucuri, any
change that occurs within the application could be categorized as a security
event, as such we try to record it.

This is important because it allows you, the website owner, the ability keep a
good eye on the various changes occurring within your environment. Who is
logging in? What changes are being made?

Here is a video of the Security Activity Monitoring feature:

This feature is logging all activity to the Sucuri cloud, for safe keeping.
This ensures that an attacker is not able to wipe your forensic data and
prevent further security analysis after a compromise. If an attacker is able
to bypass your security controls, your security logs will be kept safe within
the Sucuri Security Operations Center (SOC).

This feature is particularly important to website / system administrators and
security experts looking to understand what is going on with their website and
when it’s happening.


= Security File Integrity Monitoring =

Security File Integrity Monitoring has been fundamental to the world of
security. It’s the act of comparing a known good with the current state. If
the current state differs from the known good, you know you have a problem.
This is the basis of a lot of host Intrusion detection systems. It’s what we
have built into the plugin.

It will create a <strong>known good</strong> the minute the plugin is
installed. This will be of all the directories at the root of the install,
this includes plugins, themes and core files.

Here is a video of the Security File Integrity Monitoring feature:

= Remote Security Malware Scanning =

This feature is powered by our very powerful scanning engine, found on our
free security scanner - <a href="http://sitecheck.sucuri.net">SiteCheck</a>. It’s
important to take some time to <a
href="http://blog.sucuri.net/2012/10/ask-sucuri-how-does-sitecheck-work.html">understand
how this scanner works</a>.

Here is a video of the Remote Security Malware Scanning feature:

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGbHq7OFs3Q]

There are limitations with the way this scanner works, you can find more info
in that in the FAQ section.


= Security Blacklist Monitoring =

Another very interesting feature of the Security Malware Scanner is that it
incorporates various blacklist engines. Security blacklist engines include the
following:

<ol>
<li>Sucuri Labs</li>
<li>Google Safe Browsing</li>
<li>Norton</li>
<li>AVG</li>
<li>Phish Tank</li>
<li>ESET</li>
<li>McAfee Site Advisor</li>
<li>Yandex</li>
<li>SpamHaus</li>
<li>Bitdefender</li>
</ol>

These are some of the largest blacklisting entities, each having the ability
to directly impact your brands online reputation. By synchronize with their
environments we’re able to tell you, upon scan, whether any of them are
negatively flagging your website with a security related issue.

If they do, then via our Website AntiVirus product, we’re able to help you get
off the their security blacklist.


= Effective Security Hardening =

It’s easy to get lost in the world of security hardening. At Sucuri we clean
100’s of websites a day, many with the various security hardening
configurations you find in various WordPress Security presentations. In this
section, we add those that we feel to be most effective, and that complement
the entire Sucuri suite of products.

Here is a video of the Effective Security Hardening feature:

= Post-Hack Security Actions =

Regardless of how good your security posture is, sometimes it’s impossible to
prevent the inevitable. When this happens, we’ve included a section to help
you walk through the three key things you should do after a compromise.

Here is a video of the Post-Hack Security Actions feature:

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEPxbe9hoHw]


= Security Notifications =

Having all these security features would be useless unless you were notified
of the issues. This is why we have made available security notifications. We
have also expanded the various security related events, to provide website
owners more flexibility in regards to what they want to know about. As a
website owner, you have the option to make these security alerts as quiet or
noisy as you would like.


= Sucuri CloudProxy Website Firewall (Add On Security Service) =

This is by far the coolest security feature Sucuri has to offer everyday
website owners. It’s an enterprise grade Website Firewall known as CloudProxy.
It is designed to give you the best security protection any website can hope
for. It protects your website from a variety of website attacks and security
events to include:

<ol>
<li>Denial of Service (DOS / DDOS) Attacks</li>
<li>Exploitation of Software Vulnerabilities</li>
<li>Zero Day Disclosure Patches</li>
<li>Brute Force Attacks against your Access Control Mechanisms</li>
</ol>

This is coupled with a number of features like:

<ol>
<li>Performance Optimization</li>
<li>Advanced Access Control Features</li>
<li>Failover and Redundancy</li>
</ol>

This is not included as a <strong>Free</strong> option to the plugin, but is
integrated so that if purchased you are able to activate.  If you prefer to leverage the Sucuri Security Website Firewall (CloudProxy) product by itself, you have the option to operate the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/sucuri-cloudproxy-waf/">Website Firewall WordPress Security</a> plugin in standalone mode.

Here is a video of the Sucuri Security Website Firewall (Add On Security Service) feature:

The Sucuri Security WordPress Security plugin is built by the team that is
known for their proactive approach to security. It is built using intelligence
gathered from thousands upon thousands of remediation cases, millions of
unique domain scans and 10’s of millions of website security attack blocks.

== FAQ ==

More information can be found on the the Sucuri Security WordPress Security
plugin via our free [Knowledge Base](http://kb.sucuri.net/plugins/WordPress+Plugin/index).

= What does this plugin do that other WordPress security plugins don't do? =

A few other security plugins provide activity monitoring features, but few do
them well. The activity monitoring in this plugin is second to none, tying the
activity into the Sucuri Security Operations Center (SOC) ensuring it's safe
keeping.

This security plugin also takes a different approach to security plugins,
stripping it of what we categorize as unnecessary features for a basic website
end-user. We've narrowed the key features we felt were most pertinent to any
website owner and integrated them into this plugin.


= If I install the Sucuri Security plugin do I get a Sucuri account? =

No, this is a free plugin that we offer at no charge. It does not mean you get a free account.


= If I have the premium plugin, do I need the Free plugin? =

The free plugin will be replacing the Premium plugin in the coming weeks.
Eventually, there will only be one plugin. If you have the premium plugin, and
install the free version, the free version will overwrite the premium version.

= Do I still need Sucuri’s products if I have this plugin? =

Yes. This plugin compliments your existing security toolsets. It is not
designed to replace the Sucuri AntiVirus or Firewall products.

= Where do I get support for this plugin? =

The best place is to engage us via the <a
href=“https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/sucuri-scanner”>Support Forum. If
you are a client, <a href=“https://support.sucuri.net/support/?new”you can
submit a ticket here</a>.

= Does your plugin conflict with WordFence? =

The plugin does not, but there might be issues with our scanners. If you get
an “Unable to Properly Scan Your Site” It’s likely because the WordFence
plugin is blocking our scanner as an invalid crawler.

You would have to white list our IP address on the WordFence dashboard.


= What are the Remote Security Malware Scanning Limitations? =

Because the security malware scanner is remote, it is unable to see things
that are on the server but that are not displaying on the browser. If you are
interested in this, we encourage you to subscribe to our Website AntiVirus
product.

This issues includes things like Phishing pages, Backdoors, Mailer Scripts,
etc…

= Your plugin didn’t detect this malware? =

This happens, reference the Remote scanner limitations above. This should not
be confused with our Website AntiVirus product. If you have malware, and you
are a client, submit a ticket so that <a
href=“https://support.sucuri.net/support/?new&mremoval”>we can help you get
clean.</a>

If you are not a client, and you want to share what you have found please send
it to <a href=“mailto:labs@sucuri.net”>labs@sucuri.net</a>.

The plugin is not performing application level malware / security scanning so
this is not uncommon.

= Is it free to enable the Website Firewall option? =

No, it is not. To enable you must subscribe to the <a
href=“https://sucuri.net/website-firewall-signup”>Website Firewall
service</a>.

= Will this plugin impact the performance of my website? =

No, it will not.

= Do the logs get stored to my database? =

No, it does not.

= Are there any issues installing your plugin with any hosts? =

Not that we are aware of.

= Do I need to run this plugin to get the Website Firewall ad-on feature? =

No, it is not required. The Website Firewall (CloudProxy) runs in the cloud without
the need of anything installed. This plugin only helps see and manage the
service from the WordPress dashboard.
